        <Typography  sx={{fontFamily: 'Manrope', fontSize: answerFontSize}}>A: We recommend reading about travel in South Africa before you plan your trip. Here are a few good blogs about <Link href="https://www.africaendeavours.com/destinations/south-africa/getting-there-getting-around" target="_blank" sx={{marginLeft: '5px'}}>how to get to South Africa</Link>, <Link href="https://www.kiwi.com/stories/a-travel-guide-to-south-africa/" target="_blank" sx={{marginLeft: '5px'}}>

        <Typography  sx={{fontFamily: 'Manrope', fontSize: answerFontSize}}>A: Payments and tips are taken at your table, prior to handing your card over or inserting it in the card machine. It is customary to tip 10-15% in South Africa and cash tips are always preferred. We encourage you to tip 20%+ where possible - the exchange rate is in your favor.</Typography>

        <Typography  sx={{fontFamily: 'Manrope', fontSize: answerFontSize}}>A: Due to infrastructure challenges in South Africa, there are periods where the power will be turned off for a few hours at a time. Many tourist areas are exempt and many others have generators. 
        If you have a need for constant power, please ensure the place you're staying will be equipped during load shedding. </Typography>
